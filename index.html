    <h2>What is the Synchronicity Engine?</h2>
    <p>The Synchronicity Engine is a peer-to-peer network designed to foster a sacred gifting economy built on Gratitude. By participating in this system, members accumulate Gratitude points that can be used for decision-making, resource sharing, and sacred offerings. The Synchronicity Engine connects communities, facilitates the exchange of gifts and skills, and cultivates collective wisdom.</p>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The Synchronicity Engine operates on three core pillars:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gratitude as Currency:</strong> Every member earns Gratitude points through contributions to the community. These points reflect their influence and participation within the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Service to Self, Others, and Commons:</strong> Members can accumulate points through self-care, helping others, or offering services to the commons, such as donating resources or participating in shared projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Gratitude points are used to weigh opinions in collective decision-making processes, ensuring that the voice of each member is respected according to their contributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a href="temples.html">Temples of Refuge</a></h2>
    <p>Temples of Refuge act as physical or virtual centers where small groups (up to 144 people) come together to exchange gifts, resources, and participate in sacred activities. Each Temple operates independently but shares a common Gratitude-based economy that links it to the larger network. Members are encouraged to practice reciprocity, transparency, and stewardship.</p>

    <h2><a href="agua-lila.html">Água Lila: A Sacred Space</a></h2>
    <p>Água Lila is a Temple dedicated to worship and community within the Synchronicity Engine. It is a sacred space where members engage in rituals, collective prayer, and offerings to nourish the soul, body, and mind. As part of the greater network, Água Lila represents a tangible connection to the Divine and the community’s ongoing contribution to collective consciousness.</p>
