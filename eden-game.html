                    The Eden Game is not an escape from reality ‚Äî it is an <strong>augmentation</strong> of it. A new layer woven through our shared world, where human attention becomes the most sacred currency of all.
                </p>

                <p class="section-description">
                    The <strong>Synchronicity Engine</strong> is the technology that makes this possible‚Äîaligning collective intentions and actions around three broad categories of human flourishing:

                    <p class="feature-description">
                        Personal development and inner cultivation form the foundation of all meaningful change. This category encompasses intentions focused on discipline, focus, health, creativity, and spiritual growth.
                        <br><br>
                        When you strengthen your ability to maintain attention and act with integrity, you become a more powerful agent of positive transformation. The Synchronicity Engine tracks and rewards progress in self-mastery, recognizing that personal evolution is essential to collective healing.

                    <p class="feature-description">
                        Community building and relationship healing are fundamental to creating a thriving society. This category includes intentions around family bonds, friendship, mentorship, conflict resolution, and collaborative projects.
                        <br><br>
                        The Eden Game recognizes that no individual can create paradise alone‚Äîit emerges through the quality of our connections with one another. Actions that strengthen trust, foster communication, and build bridges between people generate some of the most valuable tokens in the system.

                    <p class="feature-description">
                        Environmental restoration and care for all living beings represents our responsibility to the larger web of life. This category encompasses land regeneration, water purification, biodiversity protection, sustainable agriculture, and wildlife conservation.
                        <br><br>
                        Every action taken to heal the Earth creates geotagged proof of stewardship that becomes visible on the global map. These tokens often carry the highest community value because they directly address the ecological crisis facing our planet.

                    <h3 class="feature-title">Intentions Emerge</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        Anyone can declare a dream and publish it to the network as an open intention. These range from personal goals like "learn to play guitar" to community projects like "plant 100 trees in the local park" to global visions like "create plastic-free oceans."
                        <br><br>
                        Each intention is categorized under Self, Other, or Planet, making it easy for like-minded people to discover and support. The most compelling intentions naturally attract more attention and collaborative energy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">Attention Flows</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        Community members browse available intentions and choose to focus their sacred attention on ones that resonate with their values. Each person can only actively support one intention at a time, ensuring that attention remains focused and meaningful rather than scattered.
                        <br><br>
                        This focused attention creates a pool of potential energy around each intention, visible as a growing light on the global stewardship map. The more people who focus on an intention, the more collective power it accumulates.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">Proof Becomes Token</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        When someone takes action on an intention they've supported, they can submit evidence of their service to the network. This might be photos of trees planted, testimony from people helped, or documentation of personal milestones achieved.
                        <br><br>
                        The system validates this proof and automatically mints a Token of Gratitude, complete with timestamp, location data, and connection to the original intention. These tokens serve as immutable records of positive action taken in the world.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">

                    <h3 class="feature-title">Blessings Are Given</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        Everyone who previously supported that intention receives notification that action has been taken and can choose to release their stored attention as a blessing. They review the proof of service and vote with either +1 (gratitude) if they believe the action genuinely served the intention, or -1 (grievance) if they feel it was insufficient or harmful.
                        <br><br>
                        This blessing process is sacred‚Äîpeople are voting with attention they previously invested, making each vote meaningful and considered. The community's collective wisdom determines the token's final value.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">Value Crystallizes</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        All blessings are weighted by the amount of attention each person previously invested in that specific intention, preventing gaming and ensuring authentic community validation. The token's final value reflects both the quality of the action taken and the resonance it creates within the community that supported it.
                        <br><br>
                        High-value tokens represent actions that truly served their intended purpose and earned genuine gratitude from invested community members. This creates a reputation system based on demonstrated service rather than self-promotion.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">Stewardship & Exchange</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        The completed token belongs to whoever performed the service and can be exchanged within the sacred economy for goods, services, and collaborative opportunities. High-value tokens often become offerings in themselves‚Äîgifted to support new intentions or traded for meaningful experiences like music lessons, home-cooked meals, or artistic commissions.
                        <br><br>
                        This creates a parallel economy where value is based on genuine service to community and planet rather than extraction or exploitation. The most valuable participants are those who consistently act with integrity in service of the whole.
