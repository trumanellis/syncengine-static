# Synchronicity Engine - Sacred Technology for Regeneration

## 🚀 Simplified Site Structure

### ✨ Single Source of Truth
All source files are now in the `src/` directory:

```
src/
├── pages/      # HTML files (edit these!)
├── styles/     # CSS files
├── scripts/    # JavaScript files
└── media/      # Images and assets
```

### 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Edit files in `src/`** (single source of truth)
2. **Build**: `npm run build` (copies to root for GitHub Pages)
3. **Deploy**: `npm run deploy` (builds, commits, and pushes)

### 📝 Available Commands

```bash
npm run build           # Build from src/ to root
npm run deploy          # Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run dev            # Start local development server
npm run verify-deployment  # Check if deployment worked
npm run health-check   # Show health check URL
npm run edit-info      # Reminder about editing in src/
```

- ✅ **No more sync scripts** or redundant copies
- ✅ **Single source of truth** in `src/` directory
