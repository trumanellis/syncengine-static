# Sacred Presence

When attention becomes presence, technology transforms into a bridge between worlds.

## The Practice

This card demonstrates how you can add background images to markdown cards. The image appears behind the text with a beautiful overlay that maintains readability while showcasing your imagery.

## Adding Your Own

Simply add frontmatter at the top of your markdown file:

```
---
backgroundImage: media/your-image.png
textColor: white
---
```

Then write your content below. The system will automatically apply the styling!
