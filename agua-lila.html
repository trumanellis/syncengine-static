    <h2>About Água Lila</h2>
    <p>Água Lila is a Temple of Refuge dedicated to the worship of the Divine in its many forms. Situated in Portugal, Água Lila serves as a node within the larger network of Temples and the Synchronicity Engine. It is a place for both physical and spiritual nourishment, where members gather to participate in sacred ceremonies, offer prayers, and share gifts.</p>
    <p>This Temple reflects the principles of the Gratitude-based economy, where members exchange resources, talents, and love with full transparency, guided by a common purpose: to serve the collective well-being of the community and honor the fractal nature of GOD found in everything.</p>

    <h2>Activities at Água Lila</h2>
    <p>At Água Lila, sacred gatherings occur regularly, bringing together members of the community for a variety of spiritual and practical activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collective Worship:</strong> Members join in collective prayers, meditation, and sacred ceremonies, offering their love and Gratitude to the Divine.</li>
        <li><strong>Sacred Offerings:</strong> Members bring gifts of abundance—whether they be material resources, skills, or time—to share with others in the Temple, embodying the spirit of giving and receiving.</li>
        <li><strong>Land Stewardship:</strong> Água Lila is built on land that is carefully stewarded by the community. Members participate in regenerative practices to heal and cultivate the earth, maintaining it as a sacred space for future generations.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Arts:</strong> The Temple is also a center for artistic expression, where members contribute their artistic gifts—music, visual arts, dance—to enrich the spiritual life of the community.

    <h2>The Sacred Art Collective</h2>
    <p>The Sacred Art Collective at Água Lila is an evolving body of work contributed by the members. It includes paintings, sculptures, music, and other forms of creative expression. These sacred artifacts not only enrich the spiritual life of the Temple but also serve to train the Oracle AI within the Synchronicity Engine. As members interact with and appreciate these artistic works, they divert their Gratitude currency to the creators, ensuring the continued flourishing of the artistic community.</p>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>Becoming a Steward of Água Lila</h2>
    <p>Stewardship at Água Lila is a sacred responsibility. Members who become Stewards of the land, tools, or other resources entrusted to the Temple are given the honor of ensuring their care and longevity. Stewards have the exclusive right to name a successor, ensuring that these resources are passed on in alignment with the Temple's values and mission.</p>
    <p>Becoming a Steward is not only a role of responsibility but also an opportunity to deepen one's connection to the land, the community, and the Divine. Stewardship is awarded to those who have demonstrated deep commitment to the well-being of the Temple and its members.</p>
