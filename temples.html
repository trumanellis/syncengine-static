    <h2>What are Temples of Refuge?</h2>
    <p>Temples of Refuge are small groups of up to 144 individuals that come together regularly to participate in the sacred gifting economy and engage in collective worship and community-building activities. Temples can be physical spaces, like homes, or even virtual spaces where members exchange gifts, resources, and spiritual insights. Each Temple is unique and reflects the values and culture of its members while sharing the overarching ethos of the Synchronicity Engine.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>Structure and Governance</h2>
    <p>Each Temple operates with a decentralized, transparent governance system. Voting on key decisions is weighted by each member's accumulated Gratitude points, reflecting their contribution to the Temple and the broader community. Temples can establish their own constitutions, outlining how decisions are made, resources are managed, and Gratitude is distributed. Stewardship of lands, tools, and sacred artifacts within each Temple is passed on through clearly defined Succession Laws, ensuring the sustainable growth and continuity of the Temple.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>Types of Gifts and Services</h2>
    <p>In the Temples of Refuge, three types of services are recognized and rewarded with Gratitude points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service to Self:</strong> Members earn Gratitude by prioritizing self-care through practices like meditation, exercise, and spiritual nourishment.</li>
        <li><strong>Service to Others:</strong> Offering skills, knowledge, or resources to another member within the Temple or the community at large is highly valued.</li>
        <li><strong>Service to the Commons:</strong> Contributing to collective resources, such as donating tools, land stewardship, or creating sacred art for the community, earns Gratitude and strengthens the Temple's foundation.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>Founding Your Own Temple</h2>
    <p>Anyone can establish their own Temple of Refuge within the Synchronicity Engine's broader network. Temples are free to experiment with different governance models, rituals, and forms of worship. The only requirement is that each Temple maintains a Gratitude-based economy and adheres to the principles of transparency, stewardship, and collective well-being. Founding a Temple enables you to gather a group of like-minded individuals who support each other spiritually, emotionally, and materially.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>Become a Steward</h2>
    <p>Members of a Temple can choose to become Stewards, responsible for managing specific resources, such as land, tools, or artistic artifacts. Stewards have the exclusive right to assign a successor, ensuring the sustainability of these resources for future generations. The Stewardship model is designed to respect the wisdom of those who have contributed the most to the Temple’s growth and to ensure that resources are used in alignment with the community's long-term goals.</p>
