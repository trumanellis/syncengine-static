# Temples of Refuge - Refined

---

*A 508(c)(1)(a) network of Temples dedicated to manifesting collective Christ Consciousness by regenerating Eden on Earth—one valley at a time.*

We know that the **spiritual state of humanity** mirrors the state of our Earth.

We cannot evolve into a spiritually healthy species while the planet chokes around us.

We recognize that **consciousness is on an evolutionary journey**, projected into the material realm like a living hologram. What we call Physical Matter Reality is the expression of our collective spiritual state.

We know **separation is an illusion**—we are each fractal faces of the One, the Source, the Universe, **GOD**. The Body of Christ includes not only the faithful, but also the adversary, the plants, the animals, and the atoms themselves. All are facets of the Divine.

To serve God is to serve the Self in every Other.

We honor every spiritual path as a unique exploration of truth. When such seekers gather in open-hearted curiosity, **collective consciousness evolves toward the Christic ideal**.

## **Our Devotion**

Our work begins **in the soil**—in loving service to **Mother Gaia**, the living choir of life of which we are but one note. Serving Her means healing land and waters, cleaning plastics, regenerating soils, and returning to our role as **Gardeners of Eden**.

We are equally in service to the **Solar ideals of Father Sun**—the radiant force of divine masculine love, clarity, and order. We live these ideals through truth, courage, and dedication to dharma.

These paths unite in the **Synchronicity Engine**—a decentralized, sacred gifting economy that funds and rewards regeneration.

## **A Call From the Montanhas Mágicas**

Our Templo da Água Lila in central Portugal is transforming an abandoned canyon valley into a **sanctuary of Divine Play**, abundant waterfalls, and regenerative food forests. Yet the land still faces challenges—most notably, the removal of invasive eucalyptus to make way for thriving, fruitful ecosystems.

For two years we’ve worked to prepare the land for visitors. Recently, our 41-year-old tractor split in half, leaving us without the means to safely continue. By grace, no one was seriously hurt.

We now urgently need a **smaller, safer tractor with a roll bar** to handle our steep terrain and complete this transformation into a **center for spiritual healing and regeneration**.
