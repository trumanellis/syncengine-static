            <p>It begins with a mysterious email—an invitation to the most important game ever played: the restoration of Paradise on Earth. Someone who has already begun planting Heaven in their own backyard recognizes your readiness and sends you the portal key.</p>
            
            <p>The subject line whispers: <em>"Your plot in Paradise awaits."</em></p>

                <p>Your attention becomes the divine force that transforms dead soil into living earth, empty lots into food forests, communities into thriving ecosystems.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>🌳 Phase 1: The Divine Planting</h3>
                <p><strong>Awakening to Your Eden:</strong> You begin by recognizing your piece of Paradise—whether it's a windowsill herb garden or acres of degraded farmland. Plant intentions like "Transform this vacant lot into a food forest" or "Build 6 inches of topsoil in my backyard."</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Genesis of Sacred Attention:</strong> As you research permaculture, study soil biology, plan polycultures, or simply sit in meditation with the land, the Engine alchemizes your attention into Blessing tokens—crystallized prayers that carry the power to manifest Eden.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>🌱 Phase 2: The Gathering of the Gardeners</h3>
                <p><strong>The Paradise Seekers Appear:</strong> Through divine synchronicity, the game reveals others nearby who share your Edenic vision. The mycorrhizal engineer who knows how to heal soil. The fruit tree grafting wizard. The grandmother who saved heritage seeds.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Sacred Exchange:</strong> When Maria arrives with her knowledge of food forest design and offers to help design your Paradise plot, the game transcends the ordinary. You offer her your Blessing tokens—not as payment, but as recognition that her gifts are helping birth Eden.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>🍎 Phase 3: Paradise Multiplies</h3>
                <p><strong>The Eden Expansion:</strong> Maria uses your tokens to access a natural building workshop, where she learns to build cob ovens for the community kitchen at the heart of your emerging food forest.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Abundance Overflow:</strong> Your single plot becomes a teaching site. Children learn where food really comes from. Neighbors start their own Paradise plots. Your personal Eden becomes a seed for the collective return to Paradise.</p>

                <p><strong>But Paradise builders need safe, reliable tools to continue the sacred work.</strong></p>
