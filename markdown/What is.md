<pre class="poem">
The Synchronicity Engine is
	a sacred attention economy that meets needs via synchronicities.
		Synchronicities happen whenever one with a gift meets the most grateful receiver.
			We only need better ways of finding each other.
				And a common currency of gratitude.

	a sacred economy that rewards harmonious action with gratitude.
		Gratitude is measured in hours of collective attention.

	a place where collective intentions are manifested via collective action.
